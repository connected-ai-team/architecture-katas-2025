# Current State of Certifiable, Inc. SoftArch Cert System

## ⚠️ Existing Process & Challenges  
The current **manual certification process** is slow, expensive and does not scale.

### 📝 **1. Test & Case Study Management**  
- **Test Modifications**  
  - Experts manually analyse test results to modify questions.  
  - Process is slow and subjective.  
- **Case Study Maintenance**  
  - Manual creation of new case studies requires significant time from expert architects.  
  - Limited number of case studies increases risk of answer leakage.
 
### 📋 **2. Manual Grading Process**  
- **Aptitude Short Answer Grading**  
  - Multiple-choice questions are auto-graded.  
  - Short-answer responses require **manual grading** by expert architects, taking **3 hours per candidate**.  
- **Architecture Solution Grading**  
  - Candidates submit a **case study-based solution**.  
  - Experts take **8 hours per candidate** to review and provide feedback.  

### 📈 **3. Scalability & Growth Challenges**  
- **200+ candidates per week, expected to grow 5-10X.**  
- Manual processes are not scalable, leading to delays in certification.  
- Increasing demand requires a new AI-driven approach.  

### 💰 **4. Cost & Resource Constraints**  
- **Experts are paid $50 per hour, making manual grading expensive.**  
- **Total grading cost per candidate:**  
  - $50 × 3 hours (Aptitude Short Answer Grading) = **$150**  
  - $50 × 8 hours (Architecture Solution Grading) = **$400**  
  - **Total cost per candidate: $550**  
- **Annual cost at 200 candidates per week:**  
  - **200 × 52 × $550 = $5.72M per year**  

### ⏱️ **5. Additional Inefficiencies**  
- **Turnaround time:** Candidates wait **a week or more** for results.  
- **Test modifications take weeks** due to manual expert analysis.  
- **New case study creation is slow**, limiting test variation.  
- **High dependency on expert availability**, causing bottlenecks.
