# **📌 Functional Requirements for AI-Powered Enhancements to the Certifiable, Inc. SoftArch Cert System**  

## **🔗 Common Functional Requirements**  
- Seamlessly integrate AI capabilities with the existing SoftArch Cert System while ensuring minimal disruption to existing workflows.  
- Support manual overrides for experts to make adjustments to AI-generated outputs.  
- Ensure AI-generated content and decisions are explainable, providing justifications for grading, question generation, and feedback.  
- Maintain version control and logging for AI-generated outputs to enable auditing, reproducibility, and rollback if necessary.  

## **📝 AI Aptitude Test Creation & Modification**  
- Analyze test performance trends to refine difficulty levels leveraging AI.  
- Generate and update test questions dynamically based on past performance data, skill gaps, and evolving industry standards.  
- Ensure AI-generated questions align with learning objectives and certification standards.  
- Detect and mitigate potential biases in AI-generated questions.  
- Provide an interface for experts to review, edit, and approve AI-generated questions before deployment.  

## **📖 AI Case Study Generation & Modification**  
- Create and refine case studies using AI based on topics provided by experts and evolving architecture trends.  
- Ensure AI-generated case studies follow real-world, industry-relevant scenarios and best practices.  
- Maintain diversity in case study examples to ensure fairness and avoid overfitting to specific solutions.  
- Present AI-generated case studies in an expert review interface, allowing validation, refinements, and approval.  

## **🧠 AI Short Answer Grading**  
- Automate grading of short-answer responses leveraging AI, ensuring consistency and fairness.  
- Use natural language understanding (NLU) to assess responses based on key concepts, correctness, and depth.  
- Generate a **grade confidence metric** for each question using self-consistency (grading the test multiple times using AI and comparing the results).  
- Identify ambiguous or uncertain cases where expert intervention is required.  
- Provide an expert review interface for validation, approval, and grading feedback before finalizing AI-generated grades.  
- Enable explainable AI feedback for students, detailing why a specific score was assigned.  

## **🏗️ AI Architecture Solution Evaluation (Grading & Feedback)**  
- Assess architecture submissions by leveraging AI to automate grading and generate structured, constructive feedback.  
- Ensure AI-driven grading aligns with predefined rubrics and industry best practices.  
- Generate a **grade confidence metric** for each specific aspect of the marking rubric using self-consistency (grading multiple times using AI and comparing the results).  
- Detect inconsistencies or low-confidence cases and flag them for expert review.  
- Provide an expert interface for validation, refinement, and grading feedback before finalizing AI-generated grades.  
- Support AI-assisted feedback that highlights strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in architecture solutions.  
- Ensure AI-generated feedback is clear, actionable, and justifiable to both students and reviewers.
