# ADR014 - Implement Authentication and Authorisation Mechanisms

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Security is critical for protecting user data and ensuring only authorised users can access specific features and information within the AI-powered services of the Certifiable, Inc. SoftArch Cert System. This includes services like Test Creation and Modification, Case Study Generation and Modification, Short Answer Grading, Architecture Solution Evaluation, and System Security and Compliance.

### Requirements  
- Secure authentication for user identity verification.  
- Compatibility with distributed systems and frontend frameworks.  
- Easy integration with future authentication enhancements such as OAuth2 and SSO.

### Business and Technical Assumptions  
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will manage authentication tokens.  
- The frontend will handle login and access workflows, integrating with backend APIs.

## Decision Drivers  
- Secure, flexible authentication and access control, user experience, scalability, and future-proofing.

## Considered Options  

### 1. Username/Password Authentication with JWT (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Lightweight, stateless, scalable, and supports frontend/backend separation.  
- **Disadvantages:** Requires secure implementation and key management.

### 2. OAuth 2.0  
- **Advantages:** Industry-standard, supports third-party identity providers.  
- **Disadvantages:** More complex initial implementation.

### 3. Third-Party Identity Providers  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies authentication, reduces development effort.  
- **Disadvantages:** Adds external dependencies, reduces control.

## Decision  
Username/password authentication with JWT is implemented for expert user authentication.

## Consequences  
- **Positive Impacts:** Secure, scalable authentication; future-ready design.  
- **Trade-offs and Limitations:** Requires secure key management.

## Mitigation Strategies  
To address these risks, Certifiable, Inc. will:  
- Implement secure key management systems for JWT tokens.  
- Provide training on secure authentication practices.  
- Integrate monitoring for authentication failures and unusual access patterns.  
- Plan for future integration with OAuth2 and SSO to enhance security and flexibility.
