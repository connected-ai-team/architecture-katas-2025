# ADR010 - Implement Caching Mechanisms 

## Status  
Accepted  

## Context and Problem Statement  
Caching can significantly improve system performance by reducing load on services and speeding up responses. The challenge is to determine appropriate caching layers, strategies, and data to cache for maximising efficiency while ensuring data consistency.

### Requirements  
- Reduce service load and response times for frequently accessed or computationally expensive data.  
- Implement robust cache invalidation strategies to maintain data consistency.  
- Ensure scalability to handle increased traffic and data volume.

### Business and Technical Assumptions  
- Frequently accessed data can be cached without significantly impacting accuracy.  
- Server-side caching with tools like Redis or Memcached can integrate easily into the existing architecture.  
- A combination of client-side and server-side caching may be required for optimal performance.  

## Decision Drivers  
- Performance, scalability, consistency, and simplicity.

## Considered Options  

### 1. Client-Side Caching  
- **Advantages:** Reduces server load by caching responses on the client side.  
- **Disadvantages:** Limited control over cache invalidation and prone to stale data.

### 2. Server-Side Caching with Redis or Memcached (Selected Option)  
- **Advantages:** Centralised caching, fast access to frequently used data, supports scalability.  
- **Disadvantages:** Requires additional infrastructure and careful configuration to avoid stale data.

### 3. No Caching  
- **Advantages:** Simplifies implementation, ensures data is always fresh.  
- **Disadvantages:** Increased service load and slower response times, especially for expensive computations.

## Decision  
Server-side caching using Redis or Memcached will be implemented to optimise performance and scalability.

## Consequences  
- **Positive Impacts:** Faster response times, reduced load on backend services, scalable solution.  
- **Trade-offs and Limitations:** Additional infrastructure required, complexity in cache management, need for monitoring to prevent memory issues.

## Mitigation Strategies  
To address these risks, Certifiable, Inc. will:  
- Allocate resources for deploying and maintaining caching infrastructure.  
- Implement clear cache invalidation policies to ensure data consistency.  
- Regularly monitor caching layers for performance and memory usage.  
- Provide training to the team for managing caching systems effectively.  
- Continuously review caching strategies to adapt to evolving system needs.
